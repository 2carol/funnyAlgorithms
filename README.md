_A repository with a bunch of funny algorithms, beginners friendly._

[Click here](https://github.com/raissonsouto/funnyAlgorithms/blob/main/portuguese.md) to check the **portuguese version** of this readme.
## Algorithms are fun, right?

So why not add the funniest algorithms in this repository? We can share with all the world so people can have fun with us! 

You can contribute in two ways:

- Add a new algorithm inside a folder, name the folder with the type of the algorithm. Example: (Algorithm: bogoSort.c, folder: sort).
- Rewrite an existing algorithm in another programming language.

It is always fun to check new algorithms or see how the same algorithms can be rewritten in different programming languages.

## Submit a pull request

After adding your funny algorithm share with us making a pull request so people can see how amazing is your algorithm.
